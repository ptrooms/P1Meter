W.i.P Home Automation via ESP8266 WiFi chip
===========================================

This project brings control using the ESP8266 NodeMCU 12E board to the Home.
The project aims control throught MQTT as a central control module for
- Thermostat state and Heating control
- measure/reading serial 115K2 serial connected P1 electricity status
- Measuring Pulsed Watermeter using an Infraded Optocoupler
- getting Lux/Light state using a LDR in Living room
- measuring Hotwater usage using a LDR on th Boiler Led
- reading Heat  delivery using 2nd erial on P1 heat-exchange device.

### Installing / using Arduino IDE
- TBD

- Install the current upstream Arduino IDE at the 1.8 level or later. The current version is at the [Arduino website](http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).
- Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
- Enter ```http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json``` into *Additional Board Manager URLs* field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
- Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install *esp8266* platform  level 2.4.1 (and don't forget to select your ESP8266 nodemcu-12E board from Tools > Board menu after installation).

```
### Using PlatformIO

[PlatformIO](http://platformio.org?utm_source=github&utm_medium=arduino-esp8266) is an open source ecosystem for IoT
development with cross platform build system, library manager and full support
for Espressif (ESP8266) development. It works on the popular host OS: macOS, Windows,
Linux 32/64, Linux ARM (like Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, CubieBoard).

- [What is PlatformIO?](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/what-is-platformio.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=arduino-esp8266)
- [PlatformIO IDE](http://platformio.org/platformio-ide?utm_source=github&utm_medium=arduino-esp8266)
- [PlatformIO Core](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=arduino-esp8266) (command line tool)
- [Advanced usage](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif8266.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=arduino-esp8266) -
  custom settings, uploading to SPIFFS, Over-the-Air (OTA), staging version
- [Integration with Cloud and Standalone IDEs](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=arduino-esp8266) -
  Cloud9, Codeanywhere, Eclipse Che (Codenvy), Atom, CLion, Eclipse, Emacs, NetBeans, Qt Creator, Sublime Text, VIM, Visual Studio, and VSCode

### Building with make

TBD 
[makeEspArduino](https://github.com/plerup/makeEspArduino) is a generic makefile for any ESP8266 Arduino project.
Using make instead of the Arduino IDE makes it easier to do automated and production builds.

### Documentation
TBD 

Documentation for latest development version: see comments in source.
Note: we use a special adapted software serial to improve bit-banging reliability to approx 90% 
In addition we've added a masked recovery routine to reduce read faults towards 98%

The program creates every 10 seconds a complex progessing statusline on serial1 that can be viewed.
- <small> ReadT3: 38.671062469 D2diChc:    60 start:  611.46301 \_C^^        endP1:  611.803833 ( 0.340773)_.6.7.8.9.0.1-2-3-4-5</small><br>
This timed state line breaks up in the following:
- ReadT3  yieldcount --> normal 2 or 3 lower we have no reads Data; disconnected or failing P1
- 38.671062469: = micros() 0-55.x
- D2thCwl -->
- - 2 = heat control mode  0-off, 1-on, 2-heat follows 3-disabled
- - t = Thermostate read d-isabled T-On , h = heating state A-ctive i-nactive
- - w = Watertapping h-igh port, l-ow-port  l = c-old, w-arm 
- : 60 = mqtt published counter output
- start: 611.46301  --> timer() loop timer P1 started serial (header) read 0-4300secs
-  \_C = state of P1 record \_C=ok, Z\_= not processable R\_ recovered (preceded by ToD: currentTimeS2=183916 \_R)
- ^^.. = one or more is number of mqtt publishess reagrdless of \(/error/log/p1/power topic etc.etc.\)
- endP1:  611.803833 --> timer() loop timer P1 finished (trailer)
- \( 0.340773\)_  = total time serial port P1 was occupied
- .6 --> progressing within 10 seconds loop
- multiple diacritics: . = Serial1P1 , - = Serial2 while water counter is unchanged. State table:
- - \* \' \" \_   = water counting
- - \: \- \; \-   = water not counting
- - \* \\ \: \-   = SerialP1 waiting for input
- - \* \" \: \;   = SerialP2 waiting for input

### Testing
To test the functionality, one can use the following script sequence to send data to the attached 

`while sleep 8; do ./sendp1.sh > /dev/ttyUSB2; sleep 2; ./sendp2.sh > /dev/ttyUSB2; done``


### Issues and support ###

[P1 Community Mail] - via GIT

If you encounter an issue which you think is a bug in Source or the modified libraries, you are welcome to submit it here on Github: https://github.com/ptrooms/P1meter/issues.

Please provide as much context as possible:

- ESP8266/Arduino core version which you are using (you can check it in Boards Manager)
- your sketch code; please wrap it into a code block, see [Github markdown manual](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code)
- when encountering an issue which happens at run time, attach serial output. Wrap it into a code block, just like the code.
- for issues which happen at compile time, enable verbose compiler output in the IDE preferences, and attach that output (also inside a code block)
- ESP8266 development board model
- IDE settings (board choich, flash size)

### Contributing

For minor fixes of code and documentation, please go ahead and submit a pull request.

Check out the list of issues which are easy to fix â€” [easy issues for V.19](https://github.com/ptrooms/P1meter/issues). Working on them is a great way to move the project forward.

Larger changes (rewriting parts of existing code from scratch, adding new functions to the core, adding new libraries) should generally be discussed by opening an issue first.

Feature branches with lots of small commits (especially titled "oops", "fix typo", "forgot to add file", etc.) should be squashed before opening a pull request. At the same time, please refrain from putting multiple unrelated changes into a single pull request.
