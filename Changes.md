# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - Development
## [V21.23]
	- mqtt Callback routine shortened and incoming command done in mainloop

## [V21.22]
	- 19apr21 21u38 option added to make nodemcu Ip adress static
	- -- override added/extended with production/static Ip information
	- 19apr21 21u38 display library version at start
	- 15apr21 00u02 changed to platformio 1.6.0 (uses arduino 2.4.0) to check if this stabilize
	- 15apr21 00u02 platformio 1.7.0 (uses arduino 2.4.1) wdt reset after 500-800 reads
	- removed delay in local-yields
## [V21.21]
- 14apr21 01u50 only output to mqtt if it is connected  via "if (client.connected())" 
- 13apr21 18u38 V21 added progress line-counter tio research where WDT hits....
	--- (+9sec after last mqtt)
- 13apr21 18u38 V21 improved WDT as we call "mqtt client".loop() during speific yields,
	-- normal yield does support Wifi but NOT the (disconnected) Pubsubclient
	-- Beautified
## [V21.20]
- 11apr21 16u29 V20: added JSON error message to topic /error/.. if P1 serial is not (properly) connected
	-- /error/t1 {"error":001 ,"msg":"serial not connected", "mqttCnt":28}
- 11apr21 15u16 mqtt timeout (override) set from 15 to 60 seconds #define MQTT_KEEPALIVE = 60
	-- sometimes the mqtt server is very busy and we do not want a preliminary reboot
- 11apr21 15u15 Added mqtt server address  in serial debug at startup
## [V21.19]
- 08apr20 05u30 - PtrO Adapted to Arduino-IDE (checked) & PlatformIO  (checked) see ini files.
- 07apr21 19u13 - PtrO Initiial GIT version , Arduino compile succesfull using this Repo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Old log within program at development site:
- 04apr21 V21.19/241 Hardware Library 2.4.1 and use Lwip 2.0 lower memory, very stable
- 03apr21 V21.18/274 Lower mempry no features
- 03apr21 V21.18/274 -68 bytes: Refactored incude libraries UseP1SoftSerialLIB will include <SoftwareSerial241>
- 03apr21 V21.18/274 +332 bytes: sprintf causes corruption, use snprinf when using multiple formatted valaues 
		-- removed unused librabries //here ESP8266mDNS.h ESP8266HTTPClient.h WiFiUdp.h OneWire.h
- 03apr21 V21.18/274 +4bytes: Progress message changed to 
		-- M#@t=15 @201, TimeP1="000309" (e#=0)    Gpio5:1, Water#:0, Hot#:0, WaterState:0, Trg#:0, DbC#:0, Int#:344 .
-      - debug output: mqttcnt/secs  P1-readed hhmmss  CrcE    state    count     Ledl    sensor        #number Debounce Interval
- 03apr21 V21.17/274 mqtt buffer increated from 360 to 480
		-- if serial data contain a space, it is also counted as invalid character (field e#=xxx)
		-- buffer too small, leading to JSON failures
		-- when dynamically adding "Force, Ttrigger and PullUp fields causing "}" deletion overflow
- 03apr21 V21.17/274 changed BLUE-LED state will invert during watertrigger (will reset at end by thermostate)
		-- Normally this wil show  & relfect the  (stable) Thermostate ON/OFF state
		-- during mqtt & active serial P1 read/processiong it will blink for that  (short) duration
		-- During Watertapping, the BLUE_LED will be pulsed by the attached interrupts (hence twice per liter).
- 03apr21 V21.17/274 streamlined source and added loop-() check timer 1 second interval to limit WDT reset risks
- 02apr21 V21.16/274 testOnly chekc ISR P1serial timings  Header/Trailer (hardly a cycle and near to a ÂµSec)
- 02apr21 V21.15/274 Using My changed 240 to display serial progress
- 02apr21 V21.14/274 Only insert a date from P1Meter data in JSON mqtt if this fully nummeric else use previous (whioch could be "000000"
- 02apr21 V21.14/274 Added runtime in Seconds at Timestamp to ease PD
- 01apr21 V21.14/274 Making CRC work with esp8266 is a change of 1 top 15 as as softserial often goes in missing characters
		-- extended mqtt record with Json P1crc state 0=NotOk, 1=Valid CRC
		-- mqtt log record corrected "powerConsumptionLowTariff" exchanged with "powerConsumptionHighTariff"
		-- hardly no alternative that accepting that almost every tranaction has an error, as long we can read the values in number fields, this is OK.
		-- cleaned comments and debugging to check why CRC16 constantly fails.
- 30mar21 v21.13/274 added yield time control (p1TriggerTime) to prevent we get a wdt reset while waiting for serial input
- 30mar21 v11.13/274 added CRC , using/following [https://github.com/jantenhove/P1-Meter-ESP8266]
- 30mar21 v11.13/274 started with fixing RX2 port on GPIO2 output and GPIO4 Input, rememeber we have two class instances
		-- added yield() after reading P1 available serial data....
- 30mar21 v21.12/274 If mqtt is not connected, continue to support the primary/core thermostatic function
		-- the routines are implemented in doCritical(): processGpio() & handleOTA()
		-- the mqtt client.connect routine is added with extra code to increased wait loops stating at 2 tot 30 seconds this to prevent that unnecessary load.
		-- Note: extensive printing can significantly impact total performance.
		-- remember: the esp8266 is a single task machine that operates in a loop
- 30mar21 v21.12/274 source code added to distinquick Test from Production (TEST_MODE absent)
- 28mar21 v21.11/274 added ESP.wdtFeed() after yield() to feed the WDT timer.
- 27mar21 V21.11/274 If (inverted) ledlight1 is active (waterheating on), accumulate the watercnt also as "HotCnt"
		-- added loop timers: overall 120mSec,
		-- approx 2Sec is for 10Sec/P1 intervals minus margins 1-2 seconds,
		-- which leaves about 6 seconds for other items.
		-- added check not to process P1serial if we are already finished
		-- in case serial reads a zerolength byte, innore this
		-- improved/validation of timestamp. Without P1Meter we use millis() to calculate timestamp
		-- During forced mode (to retain) temprature functions, Mqtt display "Force:cnt"
- 26mar21 V21.10 Changed library /home/pafoxp/Arduino/libraries/SoftwareSerial-2.4.0/SoftwareSerial240.cpp
		-- void ICACHE_RAM_ATTR SoftwareSerial::rxRead() {
		-- GPIO_REG_WRITE(GPIO_STATUS_W1TC_ADDRESS, 1 << m_rxPin);  - 26mar21 Ptro done at start as per advice espressif
- 26mar21 V21.10 clearing interrupt for our WATERSENSOR_READ at start of routine
- 26mar21 V21.09 Corrected Debug print inactive/active state at command "D"
- 26mar21 V21.09 Stable version, improved reliability by fluctuating input pull-up to assist state.
- 23mar21 V21.08 hardware set to use external pullup, internal pullup  WaterSensor disabled
		-- in LoopBack testmode, the WaterSensor readstate is forewarded to GPIO2 (TX2)
		-- Introduced "W" to reWire ISR watersensor interrupt WaterTrigger1 (<>Watertrigger)
		-- Introduced "w" to switch ON (<>OFF) internal pullup for watersensor pin
- 23mar21 V21.08 revise debounce WaterTrigger via ISR, add "Z" to zeroise counters
- 21mar21 V21.07 Arrange and use old SoftwareSerial code  (of hw 2.4.0) to accomodate rs232
-   allocated dedicated softeware serial librbary version 3.3.1. as (was) used in hardwaresetup 2.4.0
		-- newer librbaries are to slow and not useful at baudrate > 57600
		-- for this: allocate SoftwareSerial-2.4.0 with name SoftwareSerial240.h/.cpp
		-- code require the use for "#define UseP1SoftSerialLIB" to disinquish from new layout
		-- new serial layout as of version 2.6.0 uses a setup that's more compatible with hardware serial library.
		-- P1 serial databuffer increased 600 bytes
- 20mar21 V21.06  prepare watertap meter T1MeterT.5.ino
		-- structured D0-D8 Arduino port schema
		-- added myserial2 (1200 baud for Kamstrup byte for byte interface)
- 29jun20 V13.05 renamed to T1MeterT.4.ino
- T1MeterT.4, external p1 renamed to t1
- 29jun20 V13.05 copied from /home/pafoxp/code-P1meter/P1Meter1.4 but for test only

- 19nov19 V13.03 tiem string with leading zeroes is sometimes/somewhere not acceptable as json-number, reverted to valu number
- 19nov19 V13.03 reverted back to 2.4.0 (2.5.2 instable rs232), add timestring is now substringed from timedate, eases conversion
- 19nov19 V13.03 l/L activates off/on Mqtt logging of kaifka meter
